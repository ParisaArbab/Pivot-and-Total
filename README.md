# Pivot-and-Total
Deliverable A:
I was tasked with constructing a single SQL query using the WITH clause or inline views to aggregate order quantities from the:
PurchaseOrderDetail table by month (extracted from PurchaseOrderHeader.OrderDate) and 
product category (from ProductCategory.name). 

This query should pivot the data by order month and include a row for the total order quantity per month. 
The database in use is MySQL Server 8, and the relevant tables are PurchaseOrderDetail, PurchaseOrderHeader, Product, ProductSubcategory, and ProductCategory. 
The AdventureWorks database schema can be referenced at the provided SQL Data Dictionary link.


Deliverable B:
Extend previous query and construct one SQL statement with WITH clause (or
inline views) to have subcategories and their subtotals.
